          <p>
            I hold a strong foundation in computer science with a focus on
            information technology, specializing in front-end development. My
            journey in web development began with mastering core technologies
            like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which led me to explore React, a
            powerful JavaScript library for building modern user interfaces. I
            started my professional career as a Junior React Developer at
            Softosys, where I gained hands-on experience in building and
            optimizing web applications. After a year at Softosys, I joined
            CodeRush for three months, further enhancing my expertise by working
            on dynamic projects. Currently, I have been contributing for over a
            year as a React Developer at UX-Qode, where I have deepened my
            knowledge in front-end development, collaborated on complex
            projects, and refined my problem-solving skills. With nearly three
            years of experience in React and web development, I have developed a
            strong ability to adapt to new technologies quickly. I am a
            proactive team player who thrives on collaboration, constructive
            feedback, and continuous learning. Passionate about building
            scalable and user-friendly applications, I am now eager to take on
            new challenges and contribute to innovative projects that push the
            boundaries of web development.
